#SOME USEFUL DEFINITIONS 

**How Python uses Indentation to control Flow:**  
Generally , programming languaged uses braces {} to define a block of code. Instead, Python uses indentation to define a block. A code block, 
(for example: a loop, a function etc.) starts with indentation and ends with the firt unintended line.Amount of indentation must be consistent 
for all that block.
 
**Don't Repeat Yourself:**  
Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself is a principle of software development. The focus of Don't repeat yourself is to avoid repetition of codes. 
First important reaon is that when you write code that performs the same tasks over and over again, any modification of one task requires 
the same change to be made to every single instance of that task! Editing every instance of a task is a lot of work.
By implementing Don't Repeat Yoursel code strategies, you can make your code:  
 1.Easier to follow and read for yourself and for other developers  
 2.Easier to update because you only have to update your code once, rather than every that code block is used
You can use loops, conditional statements and functions to aviod code repetition. 

**Design Patterns from Gang of Four:**  
A design pattern is a reusable solution to a recurring problem in software design. It is not a finished piece of code but a template that 
helps to solve a particular problem or family of problems.The gang of four, authors Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides, initiated the concept of Design Pattern in Software 
development, so that their work is known as "Gang of Four Design Patterns".  
Gang of Four Design Patterns structured under three categories:  
**Creational**: The design patterns that deal with the creation of an object.  
**Structural**: The design patterns in this category deals with the class structure such as Inheritance and Composition.  
**Behavioral**: This type of design patterns provide solution for the better interaction between objects, how to provide lose coupling, and 
flexibility to extend easily in future.
