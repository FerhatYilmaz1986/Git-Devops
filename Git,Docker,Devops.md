# BASIC TUTORIAL FOR GIT, DOCKER, AUTOMATED TESTING AND CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION

1.	What is GIT?
Git is a method of a version control. Version control is a way of storing snapshots of your code every time that you make a change.if your significant change includes errors, you can go back, and also it means that multiple people can make changes simultaneously and then they can easily be merged and so that collaborate on a project.Git is really useful for software developers for collaboration and for error control. With these benefits and ease of use, Git is used in a wide range of technology companies in the world.
2.	What is DOCKER?
Docker is best described in Wikipedia as “an open-source project that automates the deployment of software applications inside containers by providing an additional layer of abstraction and automation of OS-level virtualization on Linux”
Docker is simply a container. Containers are sometimes compared with virtual machines. Virtual Machines run applications inside a guest Operating System, which runs on virtual hardware powered by the server’s host Operating System.
Containers make a different approach: They leverage the low-level mechanics of the host operating system, and so that provide most of the isolation of virtual machines at a fraction of the computing power
