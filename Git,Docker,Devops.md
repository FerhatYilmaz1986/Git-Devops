# BASIC TUTORIAL FOR GIT, DOCKER, AUTOMATED TESTING AND CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION

## 1.	What is GIT?  

  Git is a method of a version control. Version control is a way of storing snapshots of your code every time that you make a change.if your significant change includes errors, you can go back, and also it means that multiple people can make changes simultaneously and then they can easily be merged and so that collaborate on a project.Git is really useful for software developers for collaboration and for error control. With these benefits and ease of use, Git is used in a wide range of technology companies in the world.

## 2.	What is DOCKER?  
  
  Docker is best described in Wikipedia as “an open-source project that automates the deployment of software applications inside containers by providing an additional layer of abstraction and automation of OS-level virtualization on Linux”
Docker is simply a container. Containers are sometimes compared with virtual machines. Virtual Machines run applications inside a guest Operating System, which runs on virtual hardware powered by the server’s host Operating System.
Containers make a different approach: They leverage the low-level mechanics of the host operating system, and so that provide most of the isolation of virtual machines at a fraction of the computing power
  
## 3.	What is DevOps?
  
DevOps joins developers and operations teams in order to improve collaboration and productivity by automating workflows and continuously improving application performance. It is the practice of operations and development engineers participating together in the entire  lifecycle, from design through the deployment process.
You can think DevOps as an expanded understanding of the value of collaboration between development and operations staff throughout all stages of the development lifecycle when creating and operating a service, and see how important operations has become in our increasingly fast-paced world.
Companies that incorporate DevOps get more work done in less time and more efficiently. With a team composed of cross-functional members all working in collaboration, DevOps can deliver with maximum speed, functionality, and innovation.
  
## 4.	 Benefits of implementing DevOps in your company:
  
There is waste of time and sources in a typical IT environment with people waiting for other people or other sources—or they are stuck solving the same problems over and over. When people get rid of the unsatisfying parts of their job and can instead spend that time adding value to the organization, everyone benefits.
Automated deployments and standardized production environments, key aspects of DevOps models of IT operations, make deployments predictable and help people save time from repetitive tasks to do more creative things.
  
a.	DevOps provides continuous software delivery, ease in management and faster resolution of problems. For example, lets imagine that there are two banks. Bank A is implementing DevOps and Bank B is not. There is a crash in the application of both banks. In Bank A’s side, a warning is sent to IT department, bug is fixed, new fix is deployed all in one process. In Bank B’s side, each step is conducted separately by different departments in an old school way.   
  
b.	DevOps provides faster delivery of features,  more stable operating environments, improved communication and collaboration, more time to innovate (rather than fix/maintain)  
  
c.	Besides, there are some cultural benefits. For example, DevOps making teams more productive, makes happier teams and greater professional improvement opportunities.
